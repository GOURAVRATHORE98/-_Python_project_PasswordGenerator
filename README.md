The "Password Generator" is a Python script that allows users to create secure and random passwords with a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers. The program prompts the user to input the desired quantities for each category and ensures that the inputs are valid (non-negative). It then generates a password by randomly selecting characters from predefined sets of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), symbols, and numbers. The script utilizes the random module for the selection process and ensures that the generated password is shuffled for added security.

The generated password is displayed to the user, and in case the inputs are invalid or result in an empty password, appropriate messages are displayed. The script is a simple yet effective tool for creating diverse and strong passwords, which can be useful for enhancing security across various online platforms.

To use the Password Generator, users can run the script and follow the prompts to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. The final password is then presented to them for immediate use. The script provides a basic foundation for a password generator, and users can modify and extend it based on their specific requirements or integrate it into other projects as needed.
